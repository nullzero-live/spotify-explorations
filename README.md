# Spotify Explorations

A personal project to explore Spotify API data and ultimately answer the perennial question - what's my taste in music? An exercise in exploratory data and self analysis in one of my favourite domains. Music has my heart and to expand my knowledge and skill in the space of Data Science I felt an end-end ideation to production dabble could be some fun.
